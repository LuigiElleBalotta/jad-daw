# Logic Pro 11.2: Mixer window

Seen on 2026-10-09 with the Mixer area open under the Tracks area (control bar button 3 of the second group, shortcut X). Five strips: two
audio tracks, "Inst 1" (instrument), "Stereo Out", "Master".

## Header (local menu bar)

Left to right: back arrow · **Edit ▾** · **Options ▾** · **View ▾** · **Sends on Faders:** (a power icon + popup, "Off") · centred segmented **Single | Tracks
| All** (Tracks lit) · type filters **Audio | Inst | Aux | Bus | Input | Output | Master/VCA | MIDI** (all lit blue when shown) · two layout icons at the far right.

## Layout of a strip (top to bottom)

A label column at the left names the rows: Setting · Gain Reduction · EQ · MIDI FX · Input · Audio FX · Sends · Output · Group · Automation · (icon) ·
Pan · dB. Each strip then has: Setting button · Gain Reduction meter bar · EQ display · MIDI FX slot · Input (audio: input source with a small
eye/circle icon; instrument: the green plug-in name) · Audio FX slots (blue, the empty tail slot at half height; "Mastering" slot on the output strip) ·
Sends · Output button ("St Out") · Group · automation mode ("Read", green text) · track icon tile (colour by type: blue audio, green instrument, pink output,
purple master) · Pan knob · dB field with peak field · fader with dB scale, level meter · R / I buttons (record, input monitor; audio) · M S buttons
(Master has M D) · name bar coloured by type ("Madr…ori_1", "Audio 1", "Inst 1", "Stereo Out", "Master"). The output strip also shows **Bnc**.
The selected strip has a lighter background.

## Behaviour (tried by hand on 2026-10-09)

The remote view shows no cursor shape and no frame in the middle of a drag, so only results are recorded. Every change below was undone afterwards.

- **dB field:** one click puts the field in edit mode with the whole value selected (the Inspector strip follows live). Committing an edit is **one undo step**
  named after the strip and the parameter, "Audio 1: Volume". The step shows twice in the Edit menu: as "Undo Audio 1: Volume" and as "Mixer Undo Audio 1: Volume"
  (the menu entry "Include Mixer Undo Steps in Project Undo History" is on, so both stacks hold it). The Mixer keeps its own redo stack: after Undo, the Edit menu
  offers "Mixer Redo Audio 1: Volume" next to the project's own "Redo …".
  (The tool typed `-6` + Return and the field ended at -2,8 instead; the cause is the remote key injection, not a Logic rule, so nothing is concluded from it.)
- **Mute (M):** a click lights the button **blue**, the same button in the track header lights blue too, and the region of that track is drawn in grey in the Tracks
  area. Mute is **not** an undo step (the Edit menu does not mention it after it was clicked twice).
- **Solo (S):** a click lights the button **yellow**; a yellow **S** indicator appears at the left of the Tracks area toolbar (next to the "+" and the track-folder
  buttons) and the **playhead and its handle turn yellow** while a solo is active. Solo **is** an undo step: "Stereo Out: Solo" (both switching on and off are separate
  steps). The other strips do not change their look.
- **Strip types** (from the zoomed picture): audio strip: Setting button, thin Gain Reduction bar, EQ display, Input (eye or circle icon plus "In 1"), Audio FX slots,
  Sends (a rectangular field plus a small round send knob, both dark while empty), Output "St Out", Group, automation mode "Read" (green text), track icon tile, Pan
  knob, dB field plus a darker **peak field** to its right, fader with the dB scale on the left and the level meter with its own scale on the right, **R** and **I**
  buttons (R in red text, I fills orange when input monitoring is on), M and S, name bar (blue for audio).
  Output strip (pink name bar): Input shows only a link icon, the Audio FX area carries a "Mastering" placeholder at its bottom, no Sends and no Output rows, a **Bnc**
  button instead of R/I. Master strip (purple): only Group, "Read" in white text, the track icon tile, a single wide dB field (no peak field), the fader and **M**
  plus **D** (dim); no pan knob, no Setting, EQ, Input, FX, Sends or Output.
- **Selected strip:** the whole strip has a lighter background than the others.
- **Pan knob:** a round grey knob with a dark ring and a small green tick at the top for the centre; the ring is dark.

### Fader and meter scales

Fader scale (labels left of the fader, top to bottom; the fader runs from +6 dB at the top to −∞ at the bottom, the 0 mark is bold and has a short line that meets the
cap's centre line). Fraction of the travel measured from the top (0 = +6 dB, 1 = −∞), read from the picture and good to about ±1 %:

| dB | 6 | 3 | 0 | −3 | −6 | −10 | −15 | −20 | −30 | −40 | −∞ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| from top | 0.00 | 0.13 | 0.26 | 0.38 | 0.52 | 0.60 | 0.71 | 0.79 | 0.87 | 0.91 | 1.00 |

So 0 dB sits at about **74 %** of the travel from the bottom, which is what our `Fader` already assumes; below −6 dB the spacing per dB shrinks steadily (about
2 % per dB between −6 and −20, then less). Minor ticks sit between the labels, denser near 0.

Meter scale (a separate narrow bar to the right of the fader, labels in dB below full scale, top to bottom): 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60.
The bar is dark grey while silent; the cap is a wide metallic grey handle with horizontal ridges.
